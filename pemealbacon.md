#### **Instructions**

##### 1. **Prepare the Brine**
1. In a large pot, combine the water, kosher salt, sugar, maple syrup, peppercorns, mustard seeds, bay leaves, and garlic.
2. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the salt and sugar dissolve. Do not boil.
3. Remove from heat and let the brine cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until completely cold.

##### 2. **Cure the Pork**
1. Place the pork loin in a large food-safe container. Ensure it fits comfortably under a plate to keep it submerged in the brine.
2. Pour the cooled brine over the pork, ensuring it is fully covered.
3. Refrigerate for **3-4 days** (or up to 5 if you want stronger curing). Turn the pork occasionally to ensure even curing.

##### 3. **Soak After Brining**
1. Remove the pork from the brine and rinse thoroughly under cold water.
2. Soak the pork in fresh, cold water for 1-2 hours to reduce saltiness further.
3. Pat it dry with paper towels and let it rest uncovered in the fridge for 12-24 hours to form a sticky surface (pellicle).

##### 4. **Coat with Cornmeal**
1. Spread the yellow cornmeal evenly on a large plate.
2. Roll the pork loin in the cornmeal, pressing gently to create a uniform coating.

##### 5. **Cook or Store**
- **To store:** Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for longer storage.
- **To cook:** Slice into 1/4-inch-thick medallions. Pan-fry over medium heat for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown and fully cooked.

#### **Notes & Serving Suggestions**
- **Flavor Balance:** The reduced salt and addition of maple syrup bring a subtle sweetness to the bacon.
- **Quick Cooking Tip:** For less salt in the cooked bacon, blanch the slices in boiling water for 1-2 minutes before pan-frying.
- **Serving:** Pair with eggs, toast, or roasted potatoes. Add a drizzle of maple syrup for extra indulgence.
