Instructions:

1. Prepare the Broccoli and Onion:

Wash and thoroughly dry the broccoli. Roughly chop it into bite-sized pieces and place it in a large mixing bowl.

Add the finely diced red onion to the bowl.



2. Make the Dressing:

In a separate bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, celery seed, black pepper, and a pinch of salt.

Taste the dressing and adjust seasoning as needed, ensuring it’s not overly sweet.



3. Combine and Marinate:

Pour the dressing over the broccoli and red onion. Toss well to coat evenly.

Cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to meld and the vegetables to soften slightly.



4. Add Toppings Before Serving:

Just before serving, toss the salad again. Transfer it to a serving dish.

Sprinkle the bacon, cheddar cheese, and sunflower seeds over the top as toppings.



5. Serve:

Serve the salad chilled or at room temperature. Enjoy the crunchy, smoky, and savory combination!
