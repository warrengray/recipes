### **Savory Scottish-Style Shortbread Cookies with Cheddar and Thyme**

#### **Ingredients:**
- **1 cup (2 sticks)** unsalted butter, softened
- **1/4 cup** granulated sugar *(a touch of sweetness)*
- **1 cup** shredded sharp cheddar cheese *(fine shred works best)*
- **1 3/4 cups** all-purpose flour
- **2 tablespoons** cornstarch *(for a tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture)*
- **1 teaspoon** chopped fresh thyme *(or 1/2 tsp dried thyme)*
- **1/2 teaspoon** fine salt
- **1/4 teaspoon** black pepper
- Flaky sea salt *(for topping)*

#### **Instructions:**
1. **Prepare the Dough:**
    - In a large bowl, cream together softened butter and sugar until smooth and fluffy.
    - Add shredded cheddar cheese and mix until evenly combined.
    - In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, thyme, salt, and black pepper.
    - Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing gently until the dough just comes together. Avoid overmixing.

2. **Chill the Dough:**
    - Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Shape it into a log about 1.5 inches in diameter.
    - Wrap the log tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least **1 hour** (or up to overnight). This helps firm up the butter and improves the shortbread texture.

3. **Preheat the Oven:**
    - Preheat to **325°F (160°C)**. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

4. **Slice and Bake:**
    - Remove the chilled dough and slice it into **1/4-inch thick rounds**.
    - Place slices on the baking sheet, spacing them slightly apart. Sprinkle lightly with flaky sea salt.
    - Bake for **18-22 minutes**, or until the edges are *lightly golden*.

   *Tip: Keep an eye on them after 18 minutes — the subtle browning happens quickly.*

5. **Cool and Serve:**
    - Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.
    - Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 3-5 days, or refrigerate for a firmer texture.
