The J.D. Power Trip
“Awarded for Excellence in Overindulgence”

Ingredients:

1.5 oz Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey

1.5 oz Powers Gold Label Irish Whiskey

0.25 oz sweet vermouth (just enough to pretend there’s nuance)

2 dashes Angostura bitters (because dignity deserves complexity)

Orange peel for garnish (a citrus nod to golden trophies)


Instructions:

1. Add Jack, Powers, vermouth, and bitters to a mixing glass with ice.


2. Stir while reciting your acceptance speech.


3. Strain into a rocks glass over a single large ice cube.


4. Garnish with an orange twist shaped like a tiny steering wheel or dollar sign.



Optional presentation: Serve the glass on a miniature pedestal, or print out a fake J.D. Power plaque with “Most Likely to Forget How They Got Home” etched on it.
