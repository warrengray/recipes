Below is a straightforward recipe for a curry chicken meat pie with potatoes, peas, and a rich gravy reminiscent of samosa filling—perfectly suited to your pre-made pie shell. The key is to cook down the filling until it’s thick and coat-the-spoon rich, so it will hold up nicely in the oven.

Ingredients

1 unbaked 9-inch pie shell (store-bought or homemade)

1 lb (450 g) boneless chicken, cut into bite-size chunks (thighs or breasts work well)

2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced into small chunks

1 cup (about 150 g) peas (fresh or frozen)

1 medium onion, finely chopped

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced or grated

1–2 tablespoons curry powder (adjust to taste; you can also mix with additional spices like cumin, coriander, or garam masala)

½–1 teaspoon red chili flakes or chili powder (optional, if you like heat)

1 tablespoon tomato paste (optional, adds a bit of tang and color)

1½ cups (360 ml) chicken stock (or water)

½ cup (120 ml) coconut milk OR ¼ cup (60 ml) heavy cream (optional but helps create a richer sauce)

2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil (e.g., vegetable or canola)

1½ tablespoons all-purpose flour (or cornstarch), for thickening

Salt and black pepper, to taste

Equipment

Large skillet or Dutch oven

Spoon or spatula for stirring

Pie plate (if your pie shell isn’t already in one)

Baking sheet (optional, to catch any drips)

Instructions

1. Preheat the oven
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). If you have a pie plate and an unbaked pie shell, line the plate with your pie shell. (If you already have a complete shell in a disposable tin, skip this step.)


2. Sauté aromatics

Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

Add the chopped onion, and cook until it softens and starts to become translucent, about 4–5 minutes.

Stir in the garlic and ginger, cooking for another minute (be careful not to burn the garlic).



3. Brown the chicken

Add the chicken chunks to the skillet. Season lightly with salt and pepper.

Cook until the chicken is lightly browned on all sides, about 5–6 minutes. It does not have to be fully cooked through at this stage.



4. Add spices and tomato paste

Stir in the curry powder, chili flakes/chili powder (if using), and tomato paste (if using).

Continue to cook for another minute, allowing the spices to bloom and become fragrant.



5. Combine potatoes, peas, and liquid

Add the diced potatoes and peas. Stir everything together.

Pour in the chicken stock. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan—those add flavor.

If you prefer a creamier gravy, stir in the coconut milk or heavy cream at this time.



6. Thicken the sauce

In a small bowl, mix the flour (or cornstarch) with a few tablespoons of cold water to form a slurry.

Stir this slurry into the simmering curry mixture.

Bring the sauce to a gentle boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Let it cook for about 10–15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender and the sauce has thickened.

If it seems too thick, you can thin it slightly with more stock or water.

If it’s too thin, simmer uncovered for a few extra minutes to reduce.




7. Taste and adjust seasoning

Check the seasoning, adding more salt, pepper, or additional curry powder to taste.

You want the mixture to be well-seasoned because the pie shell can mellow the flavors slightly.



8. Assemble the pie

Spoon the thickened curry chicken filling into the pie shell.

If you prefer, you can top it with another layer of pie dough or puff pastry for a fully enclosed pie—just remember to cut a few slits for steam to escape. Otherwise, an open-faced pie works too.



9. Bake

Place the pie on a baking sheet (this helps catch any drips).

Transfer to the preheated oven and bake for 25–35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.

If you’re using a top crust or puff pastry, brush it lightly with an egg wash (1 egg whisked with 1 tablespoon of water) for extra color.



10. Rest and serve



Let the pie rest for about 10 minutes before cutting. This helps the filling set.

Slice and enjoy with a simple side salad or chutney.

Tips & Variations

1. Alternative Proteins: Swap chicken for turkey, ground beef, or lamb.


2. Vegetarian Option: Omit the chicken, add extra vegetables like carrots, cauliflower, or chickpeas, and use vegetable stock.


3. Spice Mix: Feel free to experiment with different spice blends—garam masala or a bit of turmeric adds extra flavor and color.


4. Make Ahead: Prepare the filling in advance and store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days. Assemble and bake when ready.


5. Serving Suggestion: For a classic samosa vibe, serve each slice with a bit of mango chutney or fresh mint-coriander chutney on the side.

Enjoy your curry chicken meat pie! By reducing and thickening the filling before baking, you’ll have a tasty, rich gravy that complements the flaky pie shell—and no thin, soupy surprises. Bon appétit!
