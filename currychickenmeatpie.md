Curry Chicken Meat Pie with Potatoes & Peas

Ingredients

1 unbaked 9-inch pie shell (store-bought or homemade)

1 lb (450 g) boneless chicken, cut into bite-size chunks

1 cup (about 150 g) peas (fresh or frozen)

1 medium onion, finely chopped

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced or grated

2–3 tablespoons curry powder (go generous for robust flavor)

½ tablespoon chili powder (or to taste for heat)

1 tablespoon tomato paste (optional, adds color and tang)

1½ cups (360 ml) chicken stock (or water)

½ cup (120 ml) coconut milk or ¼ cup (60 ml) heavy cream (optional, for richer sauce)

2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil (e.g., canola or vegetable)

1½ tablespoons all-purpose flour (or cornstarch) + a few tablespoons water (for slurry)

Salt and black pepper, to taste


Equipment

Large skillet or Dutch oven

Mixing spoon or spatula

9-inch pie dish (if the pie shell isn’t already in one)

Instructions

1. Preheat the Oven

Preheat to 375°F (190°C).



2. Brown the Chicken

Warm 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Pat the chicken pieces dry and season lightly with salt and pepper.

Add them to the hot skillet in a single layer (work in batches if needed so they don’t steam).

Brown for 3–4 minutes on each side. Remove and set aside.



3. Sauté Aromatics

In the same skillet (with the browned bits left in the pan), reduce heat to medium.

Add the chopped onion and cook until it becomes translucent, about 4–5 minutes.

Stir in garlic and ginger, cooking for about 1 minute more (avoid burning).



4. Bloom Spices & Reintroduce Chicken

Return the browned chicken to the skillet.

Add 2–3 tablespoons curry powder and ½ tablespoon chili powder. Stir for 1 minute to let the spices bloom.

For extra depth, add 1 tablespoon tomato paste (optional).



5. Add Potatoes, Peas & Liquid

Stir in the diced potatoes and peas.

Pour in 1½ cups (360 ml) chicken stock (or water).

If you want a creamier gravy, stir in ½ cup (120 ml) coconut milk or ¼ cup heavy cream.



6. Thicken the Filling

In a small bowl, combine 1½ tablespoons flour (or cornstarch) with a few tablespoons of cold water to form a slurry.

Stir this slurry into the simmering curry.

Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce to a simmer.

Cook for about 10–15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender and the sauce has thickened to a stew-like consistency.

Tip: If the sauce is too thick, add a splash more stock. If it’s too thin, simmer uncovered a bit longer.




7. Taste & Adjust Seasoning

Add salt and pepper to taste. Don’t be shy about adjusting—this filling should be bold and well-seasoned.



8. Cool the Filling

Remove from heat and let the filling rest for 5–10 minutes.

This step prevents the crust from getting soggy by allowing excess steam and moisture to escape.



9. Assemble the Pie

If you prefer an extra-crisp bottom crust, par-bake (blind bake) your pie shell for 10–12 minutes. Otherwise, you can skip that.

Spoon the slightly cooled filling into the unbaked 9-inch pie shell.

Optional: Top with a second layer of pastry, making sure to cut slits for steam to escape.



10. Bake



Place the pie on a baking sheet (to catch any overflow).

Bake in the preheated 375°F (190°C) oven for about 35 minutes, or until the top crust is flaky and golden, and the filling is bubbling around the edges.


11. Rest



Let the pie rest for at least 20 minutes before slicing. This resting time helps the filling set and makes for cleaner slices.

Serving & Additional Tips

Bottom Crust Texture: After 35 minutes, the bottom crust will be slightly soft but not soggy, and the top crust will be nicely flaky.

Salt Check: If it tastes under-seasoned at the end, a finishing sprinkle of salt can make all the flavors pop.

Variations:

Swap chicken for lamb, turkey, or ground beef.

For a vegetarian option, omit chicken and add more veggies or legumes (chickpeas, carrots, cauliflower).


Storage: Cool leftovers completely, then store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.


Enjoy your Curry Chicken Meat Pie—a comforting dish that combines the vibrant spices of curry with a rich, hearty filling and a wonderfully crisp (yet slightly soft-bottomed) crust. Bon appétit!
